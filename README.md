Hi I'm Samson. I'm currently majoring in ADSE at APTECH. In my free time i enjoy playing FIFA.
Python is currently my favorite programing language because it's versatile and beginner friendly, I've done a few project with python such as BMI calculator, Guessing game, Rock/Papper/Scissors, FizzBuzz.
